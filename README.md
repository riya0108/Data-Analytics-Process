# Data-Analytics-Process

## Description
We use Data Analytics in everyday life without even knowing it.
For eg: Going to a market to buy something.


- **Plan:**\
      We first decide which things are needed before going to market. Is it a shirt, jeans, footwear etc.
- **Prepare:**\
      Next we need to check how much we are willing to spend and how to get that money.
- **Process:**\
      Then we need to check how much we want from the data. Like if we are going to buy footwear what do we want - slippers/shoes/sandals etc.
- **Analyze:**\
      One obviously won't buy things which are out of trend, Also we need to check, does the jeans which we have and the color of T-shirt we want to buy, will it make a good combination.
- **Share:**\
      Now we communicate our idea to the shopkeeper to find the best suitable fit.
- **Act:**\
      Then we finally buy it!
